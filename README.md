This script is made for any FiveM server owner. Simply type /rules in game chat, and chat will display a message to all players.

The message will look like this ingame;
[SERVER] : Here at [Insert Server Name], we strive for realistic roleplay and serious roleplay. Please make sure you are following and abiding by our rules within your time playing here. If you do not know how to find our rules, go to [insert rules link without the brackets]. Have fun!

You may change this around to say whatever you like, this is just what I made.

To restrict this command for only certain people, add the following into your server.cfg;

Using DiscordAcePerms:
"add_ace group.[ace.group] command.rules allow"

Using Steam Hex ID's:
"add_ace steam:[hexid] command.rules allow"

Restricting this command is strongly recommended as people may abuse it if it is public for anyone to use.

Have fun, and enjoy!
